## About the Video Course
Go has been gaining popularity in the last few years due to its simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use across a number of domains. This course dives deep into Goâ€™s networking API. It explores the numerous libraries available in Go to create networking programs using protocols such as IP, UDP, and TCP.

The course starts with coverage of fundamental network protocol primitives supported in the Go programming language. You will go on to learn how to create networking tools using concepts such as IP addresses and DNS lookup. From there, you take a deep dive into Go network primitives for support of UDP and TCP. You will learn about socket programming using both packet and stream based protocols to create server and client programs. Lastly, the course presents you with concepts to create robust client and server programs including streaming IO, data serialization, and secure sockets programming.
